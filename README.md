# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Artemis Financial desired to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they wanted to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API).

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I was very adiment in finding security vulnerabilities both manually and using scanning tools such as OWASP. It is importan to code securley because security breaches can lead to reputation damage and profit loss. Software security is a very imporant part of the SDLC and should be incorporated from the beggining. 

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found it difficult to spot all of the false positives. I found it helpful that the scanning tool made a easy to read report for you that also had code to suppress false positives.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I changed the connection from HTTP to HTTP so that data is encrypted and cant be seen or changed during transfer. In the future I will rely on manual inspection and relaible scanning tools to find security vulnerabilities. 

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured that my code was secure and functional using scanning tools and manual testing throughout the whole coding lifecycle. I would scan for vulnerabilities before and after refactoring code.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

OWASP was a helpful tool and so was MAVEN and Spring. These are all tools I might incorporate in the future. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I will showcase that I understand the principles of secure software development and that I have developled an app that is built on secure code.
